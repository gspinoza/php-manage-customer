# Focus Camera Junior Dev PHP Project

# Task Description
Your task is to create a basic CRUD application that allows for the management of “Customer” entities. This should be written in PHP and saved to a github repository to be shared with us. This should take you no more than a couple hours and is meant to demonstrate your capabilities and understanding of the following key concepts:

· Data validation and sanitization – User input should be validated and sanitized to protect from SQL injection.

· Dependency injection – This is an important concept in our PHP software, in this case it should be used for database connection methods.

· Inheritance principle – Demonstrate this OOP principle by reusing code, for example across multiple types of customer.

This can also demonstrate your understanding of the types of data that might conceptually make us a “Customer.”
